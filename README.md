## üöÄ Mobile Deployment Guide (No PC Needed)

Follow these steps to deploy your own instance of Rise Anime Bot from your phone.

### Step 1: Get All Your API Keys & Secrets

Before you start, you need to collect these secrets. Keep them safe.

1.  **ü§ñ `BOT_TOKEN`**:
    -   Open Telegram and talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
    -   Create a new bot using `/newbot`.
    -   BotFather will give you a token. Copy it.

2.  **üé¨ `TMDB_API_KEY`**:
    -   Go to [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) and create an account.
    -   Go to `Settings -> API` and request an API key (v3 auth). It's usually approved instantly.

3.  **üîó `GPLINKS_API`** (Optional, for link shortening):
    -   Go to a URL shortener site that provides an API (e.g., [gplinks.in](https://gplinks.in/)).
    -   Sign up and find your API key in your account dashboard.

4.  **üòé `ADMIN_ID`**:
    -   Talk to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram.
    -   It will show you your numeric User ID. Copy it.

### Step 2: Set Up the Google Sheets Database

This is your admin panel. You'll add and manage your anime/movie links here.

1.  **Create a Google Sheet**:
    -   Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com) and create a new blank sheet.
    -   Rename it to **`RiseAnimeDB`** (or any name you like, but you must set it in the config later).

2.  **Set Up Columns**:
    -   In the first row, create these exact column headers:
      `Title`, `Quality_1`, `Link_1`, `Quality_2`, `Link_2`, `Quality_3`, `Link_3`
    -   You can add more pairs like `Quality_4`, `Link_4`, etc. The bot will automatically detect them.
    -   The `Title` should be the name of the anime/movie as found on TMDb for best matching.

3.  **Get Google API Credentials (Service Account)**:
    -   Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    -   Create a **New Project**.
    -   In the search bar, find and enable **Google Sheets API** and **Google Drive API**.
    -   Go to `APIs & Services -> Credentials`.
    -   Click `+ CREATE CREDENTIALS` -> `Service account`.
    -   Give it a name (e.g., "sheets-reader") and click `CREATE AND CONTINUE`, then `DONE`.
    -   Click on the email address of the service account you just created.
    -   Go to the **KEYS** tab, click `ADD KEY` -> `Create new key`.
    -   Choose **JSON** and click `CREATE`. A `.json` file will be downloaded.

4.  **Prepare the JSON credentials**:
    -   Open the downloaded JSON file with a text editor (like aCode on Android).
    -   **Copy the entire content of the file.**
    -   You will paste this entire block of text as a single line into the Render environment variable later.

5.  **Share Your Sheet**:
    -   In the JSON file, find the `client_email` address (e.g., `sheets-reader@...iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
    -   Go back to your Google Sheet, click `Share`, and paste this email address. Give it **Editor** access.

### Step 3: Fork and Deploy on Render

1.  **Fork this Repository**:
    -   Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this GitHub page to create a copy in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Deploy to Render**:
    -   Go to [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com/).
    -   Click `New +` -> `Web Service`.
    -   Connect your GitHub account.
    -   Select your forked repository.
    -   Give your service a unique name (e.g., `rise-anime-bot`).
    -   Set **Runtime** to `Python 3`.
    -   The **Build Command** (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and **Start Command** (`python main.py`) will be auto-filled from the `Procfile`.
    -   Select the **Free** instance type.

3.  **Add Environment Variables**:
    -   Before clicking `Create Web Service`, go to the **Environment** section.
    -   Click `+ Add Environment Variable`. Add the following keys and paste the values you collected in Step 1 & 2.
        -   `BOT_TOKEN`
        -   `TMDB_API_KEY`
        -   `ADMIN_ID`
        -   `GPLINKS_API` (optional)
        -   `GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME` (e.g., `RiseAnimeDB`)
        -   `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_JSON` (Paste the **entire content** of your JSON file here).

4.  **Create Service**:
    -   Click `Create Web Service`. Render will start building and deploying your bot. It might take a few minutes.
    -   You can watch the logs to see the progress. Once you see "Bot is polling for updates...", your bot is online!

### Step 4: Keep the Bot Alive (UptimeRobot)

Render's free web services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. We need to ping it to keep it awake.

1.  On your Render dashboard, copy the URL of your service (it will look like `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`).
2.  Go to [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com) and create a free account.
3.  Click `+ Add New Monitor`.
    -   **Monitor Type**: `HTTP(S)`
    -   **Friendly Name**: `Rise Anime Bot`
    -   **URL (or IP)**: Paste your Render URL.
    -   **Monitoring Interval**: Set to every `5 minutes`.
4.  Click `Create Monitor`. You're done! Your bot will now stay online 24/7.
